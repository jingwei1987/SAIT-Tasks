Read Me:

"task_1" is the Java implementation of Task 1: Programs. As this task didn't specify the UI, I created this Java console application to read the input from the text file and then sort and pull. 
This Java implementation focuses more on the design of data structs as well as the manual implementation of quicksort function;


"task 1" is the JavaScript implementation of Task 1: Programs. I used JavaScript and HTML to build a simple UI so that the user can easily modify the search thresholds.
All the data in this JavaScript implementation is inputted in JSON format.


"task 2" is the JavaScript implementation of Task 2: Wage Calculator. As the description of this task isn't very clear about the logic to handle vacations and holidays, I assume that when a user inputs the hourly/weekly/monthly/annual salary, it will be eventually converted into average daily salary. In this case, I can deduct the days of vacations and holidays from the total (annual) salary and re-calculate all the salaries based on the deducted value. Therefore, the output will always be smaller than what the user has inputted.


Task 3: Broken Page
Please refer to my codenpen: https://codepen.io/zeuigwbt/full/eYJQVor
As codenpen overwrites the <body> tag of the page, I cannot toggle the mobile menu ($("body").toggleClass("g-mobile-nav-open") will trigger nothing). However, I don't think it a broken feature, as the same code works properly on the model page.
